# OOP-final-project
Final project for Object-Oriented Programming: a party planner, based off of Evite

This code will allow users to create and RSVP to parties (not real ones, unfortunately), and can save the user and party data to files.
The code is organized in a manner similar to MVC.
The main file to run is BradEvite.java
